Lingua::Translate version 0.01
==============================

This module performs natural language translation using Babelfish
(http://altavista.babelfish.com/) or Systran (http://www.systran.org/)

If the test suite fails, it may be because Babelfish is overloaded or
down.  I will be including a better test program at some near point in
the future that does not have this problem.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

Core Functionality:
   Pod::Constants, 0.12 or later.

Lingua::Translate::Babelfish backend:
   HTML::TokeParser
   LWP::UserAgent

Test suite functionality
   Unicode::MapUTF8 (highly recommended)
   
I have uploaded Pod::Constants 0.12 to CPAN, but unfortunately the
CPAN module is still not installing that version.  The latest version
of Pod::Constants is available at http://sam.vilain.net/pm/

Unicode::MapUTF8 isn't actually required for module operation, but you
will need it to run the test suite.  You should also be converting
your strings to be translated to UTF-8 before sending them to
Babelfish.  This module is the only sane approach to managing UTF8
that I have found under Perl 5.6, so I would call it a pre-requisite.
